## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student driven by a passion for problem-solving and growth. With strong communication skills and a collaborative spirit, I thrive in team environments. I'm eager to seize opportunities to contribute and prove my abilities. Iâ€™m currently considering pursuing a master's in CS, which is why Iâ€™m seeking a 2025 summer internship. However, I am open to a full-time position if the opportunity is available.
